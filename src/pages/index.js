                                Yeah, as you can see I work as a software
                                engineer. Notice I said *I WORK* as a software
                                engineer as opposed to *I'AM* a software
                                engineer. I say that because my work doesn't
                                define me. Isn't weird how we always introduce
                                ourselves by our professions instead of with our
                                hobbies and interests? It might be hard for some
                                of us tho. Our profession is our hobby üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª.

                                I rate them 3 out of 5 stars. The styling is
                                amazing but they feel a little "socky" after a
                                while. In terms of comfort the adidas ultra
                                boost are by far the best. But you can't deny
                                the profile of these shoes. Very innovative and
                                what the kids say these days... COOL.
